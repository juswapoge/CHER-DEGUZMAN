<h1>My Life as SHS</h1>
<p>My life as an electron student is difficult, being a student is <b>never gonna be easy when it comes to study</b>. At first thought, it was easy to get honor at this level but then the challenge starts and now saying that i was wrong and <b>pushing,stressing,depressing,lacking myself to sleep to study harder because as a slow learner is a nightmare.</b> But then my classmates that became my friends help me, we're helping each other to reach our goal that no one will be left behind. My teacher's and specially <b>my best advicer</b> for this year that is <b>my second mother</b>, helping me to reach the finish line. For now i'm getting chilly but not for too long because i know that this stage is not the hardest level and i believe that <b>winners are not people who never fail, but people who never quit.</b></p>
